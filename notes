Initialized this repository after doing some work in it

What I have done is download the pairwise comparisons of fst between all populations into the fst folder. I have merged them into PBS with the two references and plotted that a couple of ways.

I also created a pairwise comparison file, converted all fst to zscores and used zkeep column to only keep windows at minimum represented by 20 reads (2000bp-ish).

I have also calculated pi, theta, tajimas D for neutrality in the angsd folder.
I plotted that several ways to look at global changes in pi, theta, and Tajimas.

I looked at admixture on all chromosomes and k2 and k4 were most supported so I plotted those.

added a keep section to pi_5kb

Read both zfst and zpi into R and subtracted zpi from zfst with a loop. Creates windows of interest for both high divergence and low diversity

Downloaded significant gwas that I ran over the weekend. Used bonferroni to correct individual alpha values to 4e-9. Took significant regions and converted them into .bed file.
merged individual SNPs into 5kb regions with bamtools merge.

Downloaded BioConductor and input each significant gwas SNP as an interval (1 indexed) formatr
things sort of worked in R, but I'm trying to do it with bedtools.
sorting .gff file with sort

grabbing the columns that are informative of the significant regions of divergence

Figured out the admixture/sources with fstadmix

working on using Noah's script to figure out zygocity of deletion in the /data/depth/...

Used awk to format neutral regions taken from 99% distribution of genomes:
cat list_neutral | awk '{OFS=""}{s=":"}{p="-"}{print $1,s,$2,p,$3}' > list_neut_final.txt

Used bedtoos multiinter (scripts/fst/overlap.sh) to find regions of overlap between all pops as well as unique regions in each pop.
