Initialized this repository after doing some work in it

What I have done is download the pairwise comparisons of fst between all populations into the fst folder. I have merged them into PBS with the two references and plotted that a couple of ways.

I also created a pairwise comparison file, converted all fst to zscores and used zkeep column to only keep windows at minimum represented by 20 reads (2000bp-ish).

I have also calculated pi, theta, tajimas D for neutrality in the angsd folder.
I plotted that several ways to look at global changes in pi, theta, and Tajimas.

I looked at admixture on all chromosomes and k2 and k4 were most supported so I plotted those.
